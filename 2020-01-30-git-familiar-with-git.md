# git familiar with git

## About

Git is a distributed version control system. Think of it as a program that organizes your files as you change them instead of calling them `resume_final_for_real_this_time.pdf` all the time. Notably, it has functionality to easily undo and redo changes, collaborate with others, and even host your code on [https://github.com](https://github.com).

## Setup

* Install git
  * Linux: [https://git-scm.com/download/linux](https://git-scm.com/download/linux)
  * Windows: [https://git-scm.com/download/win](https://git-scm.com/download/win)
  * Mac: [https://git-scm.com/download/mac](https://git-scm.com/download/mac)

* Create a GitHub account: [https://github.com/join](https://github.com/join)

## Terminology

Git organizes your file versions in a tree-like fashion in a repository or repo. Each line of history is called a `branch`. The canonical branch for deployment is called `master`. You can change branches if you plan to change make a significant change or are collaborating with someone else. You can tell git to keep track of certain files and ignore others. When you want to add a checkpoint to your file version history, you will `commit` them along with a descriptive message. Once you have finished, you can then merge your branch with `master`.

## Basics

You should be familiar with the terminal or command line as git uses a command line interface.

* `git init` initializes the current directory as a git repository.
* `git clone [url]` retrieve and copy a repo from the url. The url should look like `https://github.com/<user>/<repo>.git`
* `git add [file]` adds the file in its current state. This must be done before committing.
* `git commit -m "[mesg]"` adds a snapshot of the repo to your branch history
* `git branch` lists your branches
* `git branch [name]` creates a new branch
* `git checkout [branch]` switches branches
* `git merge [branch]` merges the specified branch into the current branch's history
* `git remote add [alias] [url]` remote refers to a non-local repo (like one hosted on GitHub). This command will add a GitHub repo at the specified url under an alias.
* `git push [alis] [branch]` transmits local branch history to the remote

See [this cheat sheet](https://education.github.com/git-cheat-sheet-education.pdf) for common git commands. If you forget anything, git is self-documenting. You can always run `git --help`!

## Example

I want to create an app with my friend. I navigate the GitHub website and create an empty repo. Now it's hosted at https://github.com/nathanielbd/app.git.

I hop into my terminal and create some boilerplate code in a directory. While in the directory, I type `git init` on the terminal. I run `git add .` to stage all the files in my current directory for commiting. Typing `git commit -m "first commit"` adds the first snapshot to my repo's history. Running `git remote add origin https://github.com/nathanielbd/app.git` adds the remote host. I can then use the command `git push -u origin master` to send the changes in my terminal to GitHub (`-u` in this case means upstream, which is needed as I created the remote before the local repo). 

If I were to instead help my friend on an app they've already created and hosted on GitHub, I'd only need to run `git clone https://github.com/nathanielbd/app.git`. That would create a folder called 'app' that will have all of my friend's code ready to go.
